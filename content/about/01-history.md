# A Little History

Altid started out under the name **ubqt**; a pun on _ubiquity_, which is what the project was trying to provide for applications.
Unfortunately, the name was _very_ common, and to avoid legal issues in the future a new name had to be selected. Studying Danish, I learned the word _Altid_, meaning _Always_; and it seemed like a perfect fit for a name.
