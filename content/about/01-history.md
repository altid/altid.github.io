# Introduction

Altid, originally known as **ubqt**, emerged with a vision of providing ubiquity for your applications, while being highly accessible. Seeking a distinctive identity, the project evolved into Altid, inspired by the Danish word _Altid_, signifying _Always_. Our journey centers on delivering customizable accessibility software, empowering users with diverse needs. Just like our name suggests, Altid is here to provide an always accessible and inclusive digital experience.

## Our Mission

Altid, born from the passion of a solitary programmer and shaped by input from friends and family, is on a mission. We aspire to unlock the full potential of accessible, always-available programs. As we work towards our goal, Altid looks forward to welcoming specialists in accessibility, user interface design, and more. Join us on our journey to create a community-driven space for customizable software solutions that cater to diverse needs.
