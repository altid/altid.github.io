                <h2>A Little History</h2>
                <p>Altid started out under the name <bold>ubqt</bold>; a pun on <em>ubiquity</em>, which is what the project was trying to provide for applications.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the name was <em>very</em> common, and to avoid legal issues in the future a new name had to be selected. Studying Danish, I learned the word <em>Altid</em>
            , meaning <em>Always</em>; and it seemed like a perfect fit for a name.</p>
                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Currently the efforts of a single programmer, with some feedback from friends and family Altid is working towards full non-profit status, and pending funding will bring in specialists in accessibility, user interface design, etc</p>
