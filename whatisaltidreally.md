## What Is Altid Really For?

Altid is an example of what *can be* for computing. It's meant to inspire better versions of itself, though on its own it will also be perfectly fine. Altid brings about computing in a way that empowers users to perfect their interactions with technology for their own needs and usages, rather than having their interaction with technology being led a particular way.

That being said, Altid exists as a piece of a larger puzzle. It is a basic building block of a framework of residential automation, a means of providing a great home and health suite to each person (with very low or no overhead), so that each person can better focus on reaching much closer to their potential. (And, put more focus on adventures and experiences!)

Altid hopes to pave a path towards solidifying this piece of this puzzle as, "so obvious in hindsight that we can't believe it wasn't always like this". Once it's established, it will be relatively left to its own autonomy, and work will begin on other pieces of the puzzle; though technology is keeping pace very well there, so much of the work is actually done.
